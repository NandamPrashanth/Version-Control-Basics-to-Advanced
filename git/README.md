# git

## What is git?  
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code and collaborate with other developers.  

## Key Features:  
- Track history of every change  
- Branching and merging for isolated feature development  
- Revert to previous versions safely  
- Works fast and offline

Before git, we have a Centralized Version Control System, In a centralized system, there is one central server that stores the entire codebase. Everyone connects to that server to get or update the code.  

# How it works:  
- Developers must be online to access code.  
- If the central server is down or lost, all data may be lost.  
- Example: Subversion (SVN)
