# git

### What is git?  
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code and collaborate with other developers.  

### Key Features:  
- Track history of every change  
- Branching and merging for isolated feature development  
- Revert to previous versions safely  
- Works fast and offline

Before git, we have a Centralized Version Control System, In a **centralized system**, there is one central server that stores the entire codebase. Everyone connects to that server to get or update the code.  

### How it works:  
- Developers must be online to access code.  
- If the central server is down or lost, all data may be lost.  
- Example: Subversion (SVN)
  
### Distributed Version Control System  

A Distributed Version Control System is a system where every developer has a full copy of the entire repository, including the entire history of all changes — not just the latest version.

### How it works:  
- You clone the repository → you get the whole history  
- You commit changes locally → even without internet  
- You later push your changes to a shared server (like GitHub or GitLab)  
- Others can pull changes into their own copy
